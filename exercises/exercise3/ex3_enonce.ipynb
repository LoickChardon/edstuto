    "# Exercise 3: The complex temporality of real world data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we consider the complex temporality of real world data. An advantage of real world data compared to other sources of data is its rapid availability after collection. Clinical notes are for instance often available in a clinical data warehouse one day after their editions. Yet this strong advantage comes at a cost: the **heterogeneity of data temporalities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider hereafter a statistical design that considers only data collected in a timespan $[t_{start}, t_{end}]$ and we evaluate the impact of data temporality on the choice of $t_{start}$ and $t_{end}$. As underlined in the previous exercises, data that is available in a clinical data data warehouse has been collected in various clinical softwares. Each software may feature a specific temporality, leading to an important heterogeneity. Hereafter, we consider the two following characteristics of data temporality:\n",
    "- **data timeliness** refers to the time needed to integrate data in the clinical data warehouse after the occurrence of the event of interest. If $t_{extract}$ refers to the date of data extraction from the clinical data warehouse for a study, and $\\Delta t_{timeliness}$ refers to the duration separating events from the full availability of their related data in a clinical data warehouse, one should limit the timespan of a study to the period before $t_{end} = t_{extract} - \\Delta t_{timeliness}$\n",
    "- **software deployment** refers to the fact that data may be available in a medical unit only if its associated clinical software has been deployed and used in this medical unit at the date of interest. The heterogeneity due to the software deployment is not only a heterogeneity relatively to the categories of data, but also relatively to the medical units, as the deployment of a clinical software may be realized progressively in a hospital. If one knows for each medical unit $i$ and a data category $cat$ the date $t^{(0)}_{cat}(i)$ of the software deployment, one can restrict the study to medical units $i$ such that $t^{(0)}_{cat}(i)<t_{start}$. This restriction makes it possible to consider a stable source of data throughout the period of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate now these challenges on our illustrative use case. As in exercise 1, we consider only structured data which timeliness parameters are known. We moreover assume that $t_{start}$ is set to the January 1st, 2022 by the investigator and that this date cannot be modified due to methodological issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize the notebook by importing the following libraries:"
